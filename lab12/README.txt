Assignment Number: 12

Description of Assignment:
	This is a program which demonstrates the ability to create and print two dimensional arrays in different ways.
	An array of friends was constructed using six separate statements to fill each index of the array. An array of
	preferred cheeses was created and filled in the same line. An array of random numbers was created using nested
	for loops and the Random class using the method constructArray. The friends array, the cheese array, and the 
	random integer arrays were printed using the same, overloaded, method: printArray. printArray works by using 
	nested for loops to print out each index in the particular array ran through the method.
